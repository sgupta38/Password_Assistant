Password Assistant ( Developed using Qt C++ )
-

##### This password manager is solely developed for my own use. However, I believe there are many people like me which will be having a hard time in memorizing passwords.

##### In this digitalization era, we all are connected to Internet and every firm requires user registration. I found it very hard to memorize usernames and passwords for many things be it banks, iPhone apps, Netflix, job portals and many more. I have created one centralized solution which can be used to make life easy.


To directly access Password_Assistant, simply got to 'Tool' Folder.

3. Enter entity name and any username or password associated with it.
4. Suppose after a few days, you forgot username and password, all you need to do is just click on 'View' and login with master username and password.
